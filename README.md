Notable projects include:

Project 1: Reorganized the code and added a feature to this game with character-based graphics. Implements concepts of pointers, class composition, intializer lists, constructors/destructors, dynamic allocation.

Project 2: Implemented Map class using linked lists. Includes concepts of class composition (copy constructor, assignment operator), C++ aliasing, linked list data structure, and more. 
 
Project 3: Created a Super Peach Sisters game with object-oriented programming design. Includes concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation. 

Project 4: Developed a text-based dating app called Unhinged. Created a Radix Tree (compressed Trie) data structure and utilized other data structures like maps and vectors to build this project.
